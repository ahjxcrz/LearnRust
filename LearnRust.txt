Rust programming language is fundamentally about empowerment! It seems Rust is not just like C for the Operating system level! 

introducing parallelism in Rust is a relatively low-risk operation: the compiler will catch the classical mistakes for you

I like that in Rust, the compiler would catch all bugs for you, so you cannot compile, like the concurrency bugs

Cargo is dependency manager and build tool!

I didn't know Rust is also used in Bioinformatics!

Speed and Stability - Rust!
