Rust programming language is fundamentally about empowerment! It seems Rust is not just like C for the Operating system level! 

introducing parallelism in Rust is a relatively low-risk operation: the compiler will catch the classical mistakes for you

I like that in Rust, the compiler would catch all bugs for you, so you cannot compile, like the concurrency bugs

Cargo is dependency manager and build tool!

I didn't know Rust is also used in Bioinformatics!

Speed and Stability - Rust!

Installed Rust: curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.3 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh 
To configure your current shell, run:
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"

println!("Hello, world!");
It is a little bit similar to Java's println, I actually prefer print, and the ";" is similar to C

cargo new to create a new project
cargo build to build the project
cargo check to check if your project can compile
